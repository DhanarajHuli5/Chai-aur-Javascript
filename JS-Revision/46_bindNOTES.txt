By using bind(this), you ensure that the handleClick method is always called with the correct context (this referring to the instance of the React class), regardless of how or where it is invoked. This is necessary because within event listeners, this often refers to the DOM element that triggered the event, but in this case, you want it to refer to the instance of the React class.

Here's a breakdown of what happens:

this.handleClick refers to the handleClick method of the React class.

.bind(this) is called on this.handleClick. This returns a new function where this is explicitly set to the value you passed (this inside the constructor, which refers to the instance of the React class).

The returned function is then passed as the event listener function to addEventListener. Now, whenever the button is clicked and this event listener function is invoked, it retains its reference to the React instance, thanks to the binding via bind().

So, essentially, bind() creates a new function that behaves exactly like the original function (handleClick), but with a predetermined this value. In this case, it ensures that this within handleClick always refers to the instance of the React class, regardless of how or where the function is called.

Sure, let's consider what happens if .bind(this) is not used:

Without using .bind(this), when you pass this.handleClick directly as the event listener function to addEventListener, the handleClick method loses its original context (the instance of the React class). Here's why:

When you simply pass this.handleClick as the event listener function, you're essentially passing a reference to the handleClick method itself.

When the button is clicked and the event listener function is invoked, this inside handleClick will not refer to the instance of the React class anymore. Instead, this will refer to the DOM element that triggered the event (in this case, the button).

Here's a breakdown:

Without .bind(this): Inside handleClick, this would refer to the button DOM element, not the instance of the React class.

With .bind(this): Inside handleClick, this refers to the instance of the React class, as it's explicitly bound to it using .bind(this).
